# 🕰️ The Clocktower

Welcome to the Clocktower project! 🏰 This is a clocktower built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It features an analog clock with a ticking sound effect, an animated background, and a bell that rings every hour. For those who aren't used to reading an analog clock, there's a digital display in the bottom-right corner showing the current time.
